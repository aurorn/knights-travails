# Knights Travails

Knights Travails is a web application that visualizes the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard from a starting position to an ending position using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

## Features

- **Place the Knight**: Click the "Place the Knight" button, then click on a square on the chessboard to place the knight.
- **Choose End Point**: Click the "Choose End Point" button, then click on a square on the chessboard to set the knight's destination.
- **Go**: After placing the knight and setting the end point, click the "Go" button to visualize the knight's shortest path. Each square in the path will be numbered sequentially.
- **Clear**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the board and start over.
